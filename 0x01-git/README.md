Most computer users move their mouse, click on icons, drag and drop files from one folder to another.

When you're using the computer this way, you're using what's called a Graphical User Interface or GUI.
In a GUI (pronounced "gooey"), you communicate with your computer using a combination of text, images, and gestures.
